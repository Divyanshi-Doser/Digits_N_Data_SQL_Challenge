# Mission 02 – The Displacement

## Challenge Overview
Mission 2 is part of the **Digits N Data – Six Weeks To Save Reality SQL Challenge**.

In this mission, satellite scans detect unstable Infinity Stones scattered across Earth.  
The growing instability threatens the timeline, requiring immediate analytical intervention.

## Mission Objective
Identify the **continent with the lowest Stone Stability Index (SSI)** —  
the region most likely to collapse first due to temporal disruption.

## Dataset
**Stone_Locations**

The dataset includes:
- Stone names and locations
- Continents and coordinates
- Stone Stability Index (SSI)

## Approach Summary
The analysis focused on:
- Reviewing all Stone locations continent-wise
- Comparing Stability Index values
- Identifying the continent with the lowest SSI
- Flagging the most critical vulnerability zone

The result of this mission was used as the key to unlock the next challenge.

## Deliverables
